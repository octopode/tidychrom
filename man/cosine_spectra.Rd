\title{Cosine Similarity of Two Spectra}
\usage{
cosine_spectra(spec_1, spec_2, x = "mz")
}
\arguments{
\item{spec_1}{Spectrum 1 in tibble form, with x-axis named as passed}

\item{spec_2}{Spectrum 2 in tibble form, with x-axis named as passed}

\item{x}{Name of x-coordinate column (e.g. \code{mz} or \code{wl})}
}
\value{
cosine similarity score of the two spectra (dbl)
}
\description{
Takes two spectra in tibble form, calculates their cosine similarity score.
In other words, performs a full join on the x-axis, fills with 0s, then gets cosine.
}
\examples{
cos <- cosine_spectra(ions \%>\% filter(scan == 114), ions \%>\% filter(scan == 114))
> 0.94
